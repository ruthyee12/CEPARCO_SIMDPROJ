# CEPARCO_SIMDPROJ
Write a C main program to call the kernels of the C version, non-SIMD x86-64 assembly language, SIMD x86 assembly language using the XMM register, and SIMD x86 assembly language using the YMM register.

 i.) screenshot of the program output with execution time for all cases
       ii.) comparative table of execution time as well as analysis of the performance of different kernels
 (how many times faster, why is it faster, etc.)
       iii.) screenshot of the program output with correctness check (C)
       iv.) screenshot of the program output, including correctness check (x86-64)
       v.) screenshot of the program output, including correctness check (SIMD XMM register)
       vi.) screenshot of the program output, including correctness check (SIMD, YMM register)
       vii.) Discuss the problems encountered and solutions made, unique methodology used, AHA
 moments, etc
